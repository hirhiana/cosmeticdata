# Sample cosmetics dataset
cosmetics <- tibble(
  Product = c("Serum B5", "Cream B", "Toner C", "Serum HA", "Lotion"),
  Brand = c("GlowUp", "DewSkin", "PureTone", "GlowUp", "DewSkin"),
  Category = c("Serum", "Moisturizer", "Toner", "Serum", "Moisturizer"),
  Price = c(45, 60, 28, 50, 55),
  Rating = c(4.7, 4.5, 4.2, 4.8, 4.1),
  Units_Sold = c(1500, 1200, 2000, 1600, 1100),
  Country = c("Korea", "France", "Japan", "USA", "Vietnam")

# Product Rating vs Price plot
p1 <- ggplot(cosmetics, aes(x = Price, y = Rating, color = Category, text = Product)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Product Rating vs Price", x = "Price ($)", y = "Rating (out of 5)")
