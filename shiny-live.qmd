## üí° About Shinylive?

Shinylive is a new way to run Shiny apps directly in the browser ‚Äî no R server required! It uses WebAssembly (Wasm) to run a version of R in the browser itself, which means your app is completely serverless and works just like a regular web page.

This makes it easy to publish and share interactive apps and does not need deploying anything to a server like Shiny Server or shinyapps.io.

| **Latency** | Depends on server speed or internet | Instant (no server round trips) |
